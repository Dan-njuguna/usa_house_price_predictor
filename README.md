  <h1>Analysis of Dataset for House Price Prediction in the USA</h1>
  <p>This analysis is based on a dataset containing various factors related to the housing market in the USA.</p>
  
  <h2>Dataset Columns</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Income per Capita:</strong> This column represents the average income per person in the USA.</li>
    <li><strong>House Price:</strong> The price of houses in the USA.</li>
    <li><strong>Price-to-Income Ratio:</strong> Ratio of median house price to median household income, indicating affordability.</li>
    <li><strong>Percentage Change in Labour:</strong> The percentage change in labor market conditions, which could affect house prices.</li>
    <li><strong>Population Growth Rate:</strong> The rate at which the population of the USA is growing.</li>
    <li><strong>Unemployment Rate:</strong> The percentage of the labor force that is unemployed.</li>
    <li><strong>Rent Price for House Units:</strong> The rental price of housing units in the USA.</li>
    <li><strong>Nature of the Construction:</strong> Describes the type or quality of construction of the housing units.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>Analysis Process</h2>
  <ol>
    <li><strong>Data Cleaning:</strong> The dataset was cleaned to remove any missing or irrelevant data points.</li>
    <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Various statistical techniques were employed to understand the distribution and relationships between different variables.</li>
    <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> New features might have been created based on existing ones, such as deriving insights from income per capita and population growth rate.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Selection:</strong> Different machine learning models were considered for predicting house prices, based on the nature of the data and the problem statement.</li>
    <li><strong>Model Training and Evaluation:</strong> The selected model(s) were trained using the dataset, and their performance was evaluated using appropriate metrics.</li>
    <li><strong>Validation:</strong> The model's predictions were validated using techniques like cross-validation to ensure robustness.</li>
    <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Insights gained from the analysis were interpreted to understand the factors influencing house prices in the USA.</li>
  </ol>
  
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Based on the analysis, we have gained valuable insights into the housing market in the USA and developed a predictive model for house prices. Understanding factors such as income per capita, population growth rate, and unemployment rate can significantly aid in predicting house prices accurately.</p>
